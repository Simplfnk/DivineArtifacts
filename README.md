# DivineArtifacts
This mod adds two curio rings they are OP but hard to get.
to craft any of those rings, u gonna need a crystallized divine essence and an angelic ring.
the crystallized divine essence obtainable as loot from the end city chest, with a chance of 0.02 to generate.
angelic ring obtainable as loot from Woodland's mansion chest, with a chance of 0.02 to generate.
so, good lock...

this mod was inspired by the awesome mod "RingsOfAscension" by Focamacho
